                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p class="gamestatus">April 8 2025</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>The following is a message from the entity known as Gino.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Hello hello, this is Gino coming straight from the airwaves to your lovely computer. How tidy and spacious! As of today, I figured I'd migrate my gamedev blog from GameJolt to here. I'll still be posting copies of the blog there of course, but I'll consider this site the proper "home" of the blog. So hello! Nice to meet you.</p>
                <p>This blog is partially inspired in name by <i>The Word of Notch</i>, of course. Just a cozy place where I can talk about the games I'm working on without worrying about character limits and other restrictions. I could embed a whole game in a blog post if I wanted!</p>
                <p><b>What frightening power to wield at my fingertips.</b></p>
                <p>Will I do that? Nah, probably not. For now, I'll start by talking about my general plans for the future gamedev-wise.</p>
                
                <h2>Current Work</h2>
                <p>Currently, I'm easing back into working on a few games. I'm a member of a FNAF fan-game's dev team, but I've been distant since my hiatus in the second half of 2024 through last month. It's a whole lot of "I'll talk more about it soon", unfortunately. My projects are in a constant state of "not quite done enough to talk about, but I <b>REALLY</b> want to talk about them". Should have something more soon(tm).</p>
                <p>What I <i>can</i> talk about is a very fun practice project I've been working on, called <b>AMGL (Another MonoGame Library)</b>! It's a project that aims to speed up the MonoGame workflow with a built-in data-driven Entity-Component System, a handy Mathf class derived from Unity, and more. It's currently in a decent state to make some games with, but I'm not quite satisfied enough for a public release yet. I'll keep track of development on this site, though!</p>
                <p>In the same vein as AMGL, I'm also tinkering with a project currently called Caw, an RPG Maker-esque engine forked over from AMGL's code. It trims the things from AMGL that aren't necessary for a simple top-down RPG and adds a proper editor application and project system. Caw isn't nearly as close to completion as AMGL, since it already hinges on AMGL itself being completed. We'll see!</p>

                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                <p>I have a constant stream of some-good, most-bad game ideas running through my head every single day. I have the silly habit of picking up and dropping projects within a week or two of each other. So, these aren't set in stone. I might forget them-</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>"Eternus" - A multiplayer top-down sandbox RPG set on a collection of islands. Terraria-likes run in my blood, I can't escape...</li>
                    <li>"Gino Maker" - Make your own little TV head friend! I'll probably host the "game" on Itch and this website.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>That's about all I have, I think. Hopefully I'll get better at writing blog posts in the future. And hopefully I remember to post at all! Anyway, that's it. Drink water! Don't forget it!</p>
