                <h1>My Gamedev Journey</h1>
                <p class="p-left">I have been developing video games since I was 14 years old. I started out with mostly private projects before releasing my first game, a 2D sandbox caving game made in Unity called Fissure. Since then, I've been practicing non-stop to improve my skills and use my tools more efficiently. I am primarily a 2D game developer, but I have dabbled and gotten familiar with 3D games in private projects.</p>
                <p>I currently specialize in the following frameworks/engines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unity</li>
                    <li>FNA/MonoGame</li>
                    <li>Godot Engine</li>
                    <li>RPG Maker</li>
                    <li>GameMaker Studio</li>
                    <li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>My Education</h1>
                <p class="p-left">I am currently in the process of pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. Apart from that, I am largely self-taught for the better part of 5 years. I find the best way to learn something is to do something.</p>

                <h1>Why I Make Games</h1>
                <p class="p-left">As a kid, I was always fascinated by video games. Not only did I want to play them, I wanted to dissect them and discover how they worked. This motivation to deeply understand my favorite games naturally evolved into a desire to make video games myself. Like many others, I consider video games to be an art form, and I have a deep desire to express myself through interactive media. It's also incredibly fun!</p>

                <h1>Skills</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>C# programming (2022-present)</li>

                <h1>Who's the TV-head?</h1>
                <p class="p-left">That's Gino, the character I use to represent myself! They're an alien robot who wants to entertain humans.</p>
