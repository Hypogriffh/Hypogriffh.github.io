                    <p class="p-left">Fissure is a 2D sandbox-cave exploration-RPG set in a magical cavern system. Inspired by games like Terraria and Minecraft, mine ores, fight monsters, and build a base with plenty of different building blocks. This is definitely my biggest, most "complete" project to date. It was unfortunately put on hold due to a lack of motivation, but I've been trying to remake it ever since. I might return to the original project soon, as I still own it...</p>

                    <p class="p-left">FNAF R&D is a horror-simulation-FNAF fan-game that takes place in the mountains outside Salt Lake City, Utah. You play as Heather, a caretaker of a facility owned by Fazbear Entertainment's mysterious R&D department. The game is primarily inspired by Voices of the Void, with random events taking place over the course of several days of work. The game is currently on pause.</p>

                    <p class="p-left">The Fazbear Entertainment Archives is a FNAF fan-game directed by Ziku. It is a darker take on the FNAF IP, taking the form of a survival-horror game set in a forgotten factory. I was put in charge of programming and level grayboxing for the game. Unfortunately, life happened, and the project had to be put on hold. However, Ziku has expressed that they have no intention of cancelling the project.</p>

                    <p class="p-left" style="width: 70%">AMGL is a framework built on top of MonoGame that adds an Entity-Component System, quick and simple collision detection utilizing spatial grids, a built-in SaveGame class, and more. AMGL began during my first college semester to keep myself busy, and it resulted in MonoGame becoming one of my favorite frameworks to work with. There is currently no public release of AMGL, but that will change once I feel it's become feature-complete.</p>
